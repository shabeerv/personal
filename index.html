                            <p class="show-read-more">GitHub today announced that it will start publishing a public roadmap to help its users understand when it will ship new features across its various versions of the GitHub code repository and products like GitHub Actions, its mobile app and its security tools <br>

                                "What we’re trying to do is provide a way for people to see what’s coming, join in that dialogue and give us feedback and be able to collaborate with us,” GitHub’s SVP of Product Shanku Niyogi told me.
                                
                                He also noted that as the company’s enterprise business has grown, the need for customers to be able to prepare for what’s coming next has also increased. Until now, GitHub often provided this information to some of its larger customers directly (through good old slide decks), but that same information will now be available to all. To Niyogi, this is essentially about “building GitHub more the way that people build software on GitHub already.”</p>

                            <h3 class="mb-0">Buy a Used MacBook Pro: 5 Benefits of Purchasing a Refurbished MacBook Pro</h3>
                            <div class="subheading mb-3">by shabeer</div>
                            <p class="show-read-more">Are you a remote worker or a freelancer? Or, are you bootstrapping a startup? Do you need to upgrade your laptop to cope with the rigorous demands of the modern remote working environment? Have you considered purchasing a refurbished laptop for remote work? What are the benefits of buying a used laptop?<br>

                                All these questions are valid and deserve a considered response. Therefore, let’s look at the answers to each question.
                                <br>
                                What it means to buy a used MacBook Pro
                                <br>
                                Working from home or remotely can be challenging, especially in the current global crisis that has resulted in a worldwide economic pause, and, where the world is trying to figure out what the new normal is.
                                
                                The good news is that we seem to be on the positive flipside of the pandemic, with many countries slowly opening up, and people are going back to work. However, governments and medical experts are still recommending that people who can work from home, do so. Your company might provide you with a laptop. Even so, there are still merits to purchasing your own laptop. Therefore, let’s consider what it means to buy a used MacBook Pro.<br>
                                <br>
                                You reduce the negative impact on the environment
                                <br>
                                Statistics quoted by Statista.com show that 166 million new laptops were purchased in 2019.<br>
                                
                                Additionally, the manufacturing of laptops has a negative impact on the environment. Toxic chemicals and heavy metals like lead, cadmium, mercury, and chromium are used during manufacturing. The manufacturing process also discharges hazardous waste, poisonous gases, greenhouse gasses like carbon dioxide, and uses large amounts of water.
                                
                                Thus, if there is one argument that validates the purchase of a used laptop, it is the fact that refurbishing laptops, including the range of MacBook Pros, reduces the negative environmental impact caused by the manufacture of new laptops. And, you help reduce the levels of eWaste that ends up in the landfill sites.
                                
                                You save a lot of money
                                
                                Refurbished laptops cost a lot less than buying a new laptop. It’s vital to note that the definition of refurbished does not translate into second-hand. Refurbished MacBook Pros (and other laptops) have been tested and certified to function as a new laptop. Many refurbished or certified used laptops have been serviced and checked for any defects before certified for resale.
                                
                                Therefore, they are a lot cheaper than new laptops. For example, you can find used MacBook deals for under $100.
                                
                                Consequently, if you require a cheap MacBook Pro, it is a good idea to consider buying a refurbished laptop.
                                
                                A pre-owned laptop functions just like a new laptop
                                
                                A certified refurbished MacBook Pro is guaranteed to function just like a new laptop, except that you will not be the laptop’s first owner. This will not be a problem if you buy a laptop from a company like BackMarket.com. Not only are they a professional MacBook Pro refurbishing agency, but they have certified IT professionals who are qualified to check and rebuild laptops should it be required.</p>

                            <div class="subheading mb-3">Post by shabeer</div>
                            <p class="show-read-more">Are you interested in taking out a new mobile phone plus data subscription? If so, should you make sure that the new phone is compatible with the 5G network? Or, is the widespread adoption of the 5G mobile data network still far enough off to ignore for the time being?

                                By way of answering this question, let’s first look at a succinct definition of 4G and 5G, determine the differences between these technologies, and finally, look at how far off the adoption of 5G is.
                                
                                Cellular network technology: A succinct definition
                                
                                Before we consider the specifics of the 4G and 5G mobile technologies, let’s look at a succinct definition of cellular or mobile network technology.
                                
                                Wikepedia.com notes that it is a “communication network where the last link is wireless.”
                                
                                This network is distributed over land areas known as cells, each supplied with between one and three fixed-location base station receiver stations. And when joined together, these individual cells provide cell phone and data coverage over a large geographic area. Currently, mobile phone users can communicate with other cell phone users around the world.
                                
                                Each cell uses a different set of frequencies from other cells to ensure the quality transmission of data, voice, and other types of content.
                                
                                What is 4G?
                                
                                4G is the fourth generation or iteration of the mobile broadband network technology described above. And, each generation is an improvement on the generation before. For example, 4G offers faster mobile broadband network connectivity than 3G. This enables data to travel between devices at faster rate than before.
                                
                                The digitaltrends.com website notes that, for a network to be advertised as 4G, it must offer “peak data rates of at least 100Mb per second for high mobility communications… and at least 1GB per second for low mobility communications.”
                                
                                By way of explanation, high mobility communications include mobile network users in cars, trains, and busses. In other words, they are moving quickly through the area covered by the 4G networks.
                                
                                On the other hand, low mobility communication is a user who is travelling slowly through the cellular network area. These users include pedestrians and people who are not moving at all.
                                
                                What is 5G?
                                
                                It stands to reason that the 5G network is the fifth-generation mobile phone network technology. Heidi Vella of raconteur.net stated in her article published in May 2019, that it is “expected to be a step-change in mobile networking - promising exponentially faster download speeds and data-sharing in real time.”
                                
                                5G includes the following upgrades:
                                
                                <ol> A new digital system for converting bytes of data over air.</ol>
                                <ol>A new radio interface that uses much higher radio frequencies than used by the earlier iterations of this mobile network technology.</ol>
                                
                                Therefore, 5G can transfer more data through the air at faster speeds, simultaneously reducing the latency and congestion.
                                
                                In practice, more devices are supported over the same air space. Statistics show that 4G supports 4 000 devices per square kilometre, while 5G can support up to 1 million devices in the same air space. Therefore, mobile data users can stream videos, podcasts, browse the Internet, and make voice calls without interruption.
                                
                                Final thoughts
                                
                                While this technology is currently being tested, it is not yet available for public consumption. Tentative global adoption dates being touted are only in 2024. Therefore, you do not need to ensure that your new mobile phone is 5G compatible, yet.</p>
